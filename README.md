<h1>Hi, I'm Jaden Ritchie! <br/><a href="https://github.com/jadenar07">Programmer</a> and <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/jadenritchie">Aspiring Software Engineer</a><br/><br/>

<p>I am a sophomore at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. I‚Äôm currently enrolled in the Computer Science program and eager to specialize further, looking to delve into web and game development. My aspirations firmly lie in software engineering, however, I hope to be able to branch out to other CS fields as I gain more experience and tenure in the field. Beyond the academic sphere, I enjoy gaming and movies. </p>
